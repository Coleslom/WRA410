    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Something that I find interesting is exploring forests to find things people forgot about
and to enjoy the beauty of the forest. I love traveling and I want to see things others have never
experienced before. I was also part of the swim team for almost a decade and played water polo all throughout high school so swimming is also a huge passion. Professionally I enjoy creating things so web development is something
of intrest to me. My favorite things to do are remix photos by making them live drawings or create something a company is going to use and show off.
		<br> 
		<br> 
		The best definig quality about me is my compassion and understanding. I can easily see both sides of an argument and will always find the common ground in the situation. I love to help and make things better whether its as simple as making an ugly ad pretty or adding some color to a blank wall. 
		<br>
		<br>
 I believe happiness is
the key to life and I will seek it out by remaining peaceful and and learning from every
experience good or bad in order to personally grow. I seek out facts and knowledge that will help me grow my own wisdom. In order to strive for happiness I will bring things of beauty to the world so that others may enjoy them.
